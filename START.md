> ### DO NOT REPLY TO THIS POST AS IT WILL BE A COLLECTION OF COMPATIBLE MAPS

Each map will have its own post with the following markdown:

> - Map state: Completed, unfinished, abandoned, alpha, beta, etc.
> - Compatibility stage (FULL, No HUD, No PAP etc.)
> - HTTPS link for browser users.
> - Batch file which can be downloaded and executed to open the map page in the steam app itself.
